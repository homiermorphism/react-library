A new version of my Library project from The Odin Project.

Uses the following:

1. npm

2. Webpack

3. Babel

4. React

# Coming Soon

- Edit a book

- More form options (read/in progress/unread, rating, etc.)

- Reverse sorting

- Clear library button

- Favorite a book

- Animations in CSS (when adding a book, when changing the status)

# Needs Fixing
